# Unscented Kalman Filter and simulator

An Unscented Kalman Filter estimator with simulated targets embedded.

Copy the files into a directory.
Open directory with either MATLAB or Octave.
Run track_01d.m
You will see two examples of targets:
1. No noise in target
2. Noise applied to target.
This simulator needs to have error values recorded and displayed.
This sim can have any target simulated with some modification. The tracker is just tracking what you feed it.
